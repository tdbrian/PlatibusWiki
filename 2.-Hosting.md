## Loopback

The `Platibus.LoopbackHost` class in the main `Platibus` package initializes a bus in which all sent messages, publications, and replies are routed back to itself.  This is useful for implementing local event buses or for integration testing.  To start the host, simply call the static `LoopbackHost.Start` method:

```csharp
var host = await LoopbackHost.Start()
```
The following is a basic loopback host executable that will run until halted or a key is pressed:

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var host = Task.Run(async () => await LoopbackHost.Start()).Result;
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to stop the server...");
        Console.ReadKey();
        host.Dispose();
    }
}
```

The `LoopbackHost.Start` method has two overloads.  The first accepts an optional string parameter specifying the name of the `Platibus.Configuration.LoopbackConfigurationSection` to load from the app.config (the default section name is "platibus.loopback").  If this overload is used, the loopback host will be configured according to the declarative configuration specified in the named configuration section, filtered through any concrete public `IConfigurationHook` implementations found in any of the assemblies in the the app domain base directory.

For more information on Loopback server configuration, refer to the [Loopback server configuration](3.1-Loopback-Configuration) page.

## HTTP Server

The `Platibus.Http.HttpServer` class in the main `Platibus` package is a basic HTTP server that hosts a bus and transmits messages via HTTP post requests.  To start the server, simply call the static `HttpServer.Start` method:

```csharp
var server = await HttpServer.Start()
```

The following is a basic HTTP server executable that will run until halted or a key is pressed:

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var httpServer = Task.Run(async () => await HttpServer.Start()).Result;
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to stop the server...");
        Console.ReadKey();
        httpServer.Dispose();
    }
}
```

The HTTP server can also be hosted in a Windows service:

```csharp
public class HttpService : ServiceBase
{
    protected HttpServer HttpServer;

    public HttpService()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    protected override void OnStart(string[] args)
    {
        HttpServer = Task.Run(async () => await HttpServer.Start()).Result;
    }

    protected override void OnStop()
    {
        if (HttpServer != null)
        {
            HttpServer.Dispose();
            HttpServer = null;
        }
    }
}
```

The `HttpServer.Start` method has two overloads.  The first accepts an optional string parameter specifying the name of the `Platibus.Http.HttpServerConfigurationSection` to load from the app.config (the default section name is "platibus.http").  If this overload is used, the HTTP server will be configured according to the declarative configuration specified in the named configuration section, filtered through any concrete public `IConfigurationHook` implementations found in any of the assemblies in the the app domain base directory.

For more information on HTTP server configuration, refer to the [HTTP server configuration](3.2-HTTP-Server-Configuration) page.

## IIS

A Platibus instance can be hosted in IIS using the `Platibus.IIS.PlatibusHttpHandler` supplied in the `Platibus.IIS` package.  To register the handler, add the following to your web.config:

```xml
<system.webServer>
    <handlers>
        <add name="platibus" verb="*" path="platibus" type="Platibus.IIS.PlatibusHttpHandler, Platibus.IIS" />
    </handlers>
</system.webServer>
```

The path can be anything you like, but it must agree with the `baseUri` specified in the `<platibus>` configuration section.  In the above example, the configured `baseUri` would be `http://<host>:<port>/platibus` where _host_ and _port_ are the hostname and port specified in the `http` protocol binding in the web site configuration.

The bus instance will be configured in the HTTP context and can be retrieved from within a WebForm or controller via the `GetBus` extension method of the `HttpContextExtensions` class:

```csharp
public ActionResult Action(Model model)
{
    var bus = HttpContext.GetBus();
}
```

Due to the inability to specify extra configuration parameters in the `handler` element, only a single Platibus instance can be hosted.  Further, the Platibus configuration must use the default section name `platibus` in order to be recognized and honored by the HTTP handler.

For more information on IIS hosting configuration, refer to the [IIS configuration](3.3-IIS-Configuration) page.

For IIS hosting examples, see The `Platibus.SampleWebApp` project provided in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/sweetlandj/Platibus/tree/master/Source/Platibus.SampleWebApp).  This is a very basic application that demonstrates how to configure and use Platibus in an ASP.Net MVC 5 application (.NET 4.5.1 runtime required).

## OWIN Middleware

Platibus can also be configured to serve HTTP requests via OWIN middleware.  The `Platibus.Owin` package features a middleware implementation `Platibus.Owin.PlatibusMiddleware` that can will route all requests beginning with the configured `baseUri`.  To configure the middleware, add the following to the Configuration method of the OWIN startup class:

```csharp
app.UsePlatibusMiddleware();
```

The `UsePlatibusMiddleware` method has overrides to specify different configuration section names (the default is `platibus.owin`); a custom `IOwinConfiguration` object; or a programmatically configured `PlatibusMiddleware` instance.  The bus instance will be configured in the OWIN context and can be retrieved from within a controller via the `GetBus` extension method of the `OwinContextExtensions` class:

```csharp
public IHttpActionResult Post(Model m)
{
    var bus = Request.GetOwinContext().GetBus();
}
```

For OWIN hosting examples, see The `Platibus.SampleApi` project provided in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/sweetlandj/Platibus/tree/master/Source/Platibus.SampleApi).  This is a very basic application that demonstrates how to configure and use Platibus in an ASP.Net MVC 5 / WebAPI application (.NET 4.5.2 runtime required).


## Rabbit MQ

Platibus supports the use of RabbitMQ queues for transport and queueing messages.  Like the [HTTP server](#http-server), a host class is provided that implementers can call from their own executables or Windows services.

The `Platibus.RabbitMQ.RabbitMQHost` class in the `Platibus.RabbitMQ` package starts the bus instance and initializes the RabbitMQ queues and exchanges necessary to send, subscribe, and queue messages.  To start the host, simply call the static `RabbitMQHost.Start` method:

```csharp
var server = await RabbitMQHost.Start()
```

The following is a basic RabbitMQ host executable that will run until halted or a key is pressed:

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var rabbitMQHost = Task.Run(async () => await RabbitMQHost.Start()).Result;
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to stop the server...");
        Console.ReadKey();
        rabbitMQHost.Dispose();
    }
}
```

The RabbitMQ host can also be hosted in a Windows service:

```csharp
public class RabbitMQHostingService : ServiceBase
{
    protected RabbitMQHost RabbitMQHost;

    public RabbitMQHostingService()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    protected override void OnStart(string[] args)
    {
        RabbitMQHost = Task.Run(async () => await RabbitMQHost.Start()).Result;
    }

    protected override void OnStop()
    {
        if (RabbitMQHost != null)
        {
            RabbitMQHost.Dispose();
            RabbitMQHost = null;
        }
    }
}
```
The `RabbitMQHost.Start` method has two overloads.  The first accepts an optional string parameter specifying the name of the `Platibus.RabbitMQ.RabbitMQHostConfigurationSection` to load from the app.config (the default section name is "platibus.rabbitmq").  If this overload is used, the HTTP server will be configured according to the declarative configuration specified in the named configuration section, filtered through any concrete public `IConfigurationHook` implementations found in any of the assemblies in the the app domain base directory.

For more information on HTTP server configuration, refer to the [RabbitMQ configuration](3.4-RabbitMQ-Configuration) page.
